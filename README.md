# Classification-Logistic_Regression_Model
This repository contains an implementation of a Logistic Regression model, a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks.
The project is designed to help beginners and enthusiasts understand the core concepts of logistic regression and its practical implementation.

**Features**
**Binary Classification**: Classifies data into two distinct categories based on input features.

**Implementation**: Built from scratch using Python

**Visualization**: Plots decision boundaries and loss function for better interpretability.

**Tech Stack**
Python
NumPy (for matrix operations and vectorization)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Scikit learn
