# Classification-Logostic_Regression_ModelLogistic Regression Model
This repository contains an implementation of a Logistic Regression model, a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks. The project is designed to help beginners and enthusiasts understand the core concepts of logistic regression and its practical implementation.

Features
Binary Classification: Classifies data into two distinct categories based on input features.
Implementation: Built from scratch using Python, with no reliance on prebuilt libraries like Scikit-learn for educational purposes.
Mathematical Explanation: Includes step-by-step derivation of the cost function, gradient descent optimization, and sigmoid function.
Dataset: Demonstrates the model on a sample dataset, which can be replaced with your own.
Visualization: Plots decision boundaries and loss function for better interpretability.
Customizability: Easily tweak learning rates, iterations, and other hyperparameters.
Tech Stack
Python
NumPy (for matrix operations and vectorization)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
